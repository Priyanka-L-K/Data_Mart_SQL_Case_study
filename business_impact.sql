-- Region Impact: If a specific region (e.g., USA, Asia, Europe) shows a significant drop, it may indicate external factors like economic shifts or customer behavior changes.
-- Platform Shift: A drop in Retail sales but an increase in Shopify sales could suggest a shift in online shopping behavior.
-- Demographic Trends: If younger age groups or specific demographics have a sharp decline, it could indicate changing preferences.
-- Customer Type Changes: A decline in Guest or New Customers could suggest acquisition challenges, while a drop in Existing Customers might indicate loyalty issues.
